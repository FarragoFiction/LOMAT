okay, one thing i want to do is focus more on coding while i do it. i don't HAVE all day every day to work on farrago anymore so i gotta
get back to basics, back to discipline.

so that means no discord, so that means i ramble here instead. (hi wastes)

right now i'm going to spend at LEAST one hour coding LOMAT without being on discord or getting distracted.

My goals (in order) are:

* Integrate with Manic's procedural music.
* Integrate with KR's butterfly enemy
* Let towns fuck.
* Allow town caching.
* Let neighbor towns be random or cached.
* Create 'premade' towns.
* let neighbor towns also draw from premade
* implement a "triggerCondition" thing towns can have
* the default condition returns true.
* a town only is an option for triggering if its trigger condition is true
* premade towns have custom conditions (like, cattapillars killed is multiple of 85)
* allow premade towns to be built from a form and loaded from text (like big bads)
* implement travel events (effect currency, items, npc hp, time to travel, etc)
* actually have currency
* actually have an inventory/items
* actually let you pick up npcs and take them places
* allow gravestone generation (online feature???)

I think i can get 2.5 bullet points done.


At the end of nearly an hour and a half got music done, and butterfly done. 2 bullet points.
