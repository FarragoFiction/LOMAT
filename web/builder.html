          An NPC has a TALKY LEVEL which contains one or more QUESTIONS. Each question has a single RESPONSE, which itself can have one or more SUBQUESTIONS (which are part of a TALKY LEVEL). You'll want to make sure that  you build dialoge from the bottom up, starting with responses, giving them to questions, then giving those questions to a talky level and that talky level to an NPC.
